**Application Title:**

  Finch Collectors

    This app is meant for Finch lovers, who want to use all the CRUD functions so they can Create, Read, Update and Delete the Finches they have created. With that we have added a schedule so one may view and remember the necessary feeding for each individual finch along with allowing the users to upload their favorite picture of the Finch they choose as well. Lastly, we have allowed the users to view all their finches along with the toys they have added.
